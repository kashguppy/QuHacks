    <h2>What is Boba?</h2>
    
      <p>Boba, also known as bubble tea, is a popular Taiwanese drink that has gained worldwide popularity. It typically consists of a base liquid, such as tea or fruit juice, mixed with milk or non-dairy creamer and sweetened with sugar or flavored syrups. What sets boba apart are the chewy tapioca pearls, also known as boba, added to the drink. Boba comes in a variety of flavors and can be customized with different types of tea, milk, and toppings. </p>
